</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Recently, I saw a new game from Zachtronics, <a href="http://www.zachtronics.com/tis-100/"><span class="caps">TIS</span>-100</a>, which was released
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/370360/">on Steam</a> as an early access title on the first of June. In some ways,
calling it a game is overstating it: it&#8217;s basically just a collection of
programming problems with an interface. The catch is that you&#8217;re programming in
an assembly language on a virtual machine with unusual architecture. Problems
beyond the simplest will generally require you to take advantage of parallelism
(which is the primary distinguishing feature of the <span class="caps">VM</span>) to solve, which leads to
some rather different solutions for traditional problems. It&#8217;s neat, and I
suggest checking it&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>Obviously, a game like that has a rather limited target audience. Case in point:
I have previously created my own little <span class="caps">VM</span> with a fake assembly language to play
with. The game is clearly made just for me, but how many others are likely to be
similarly interested? About 11,000 so far, <a href="http://steamspy.com/app/370360">apparently</a>.</p>
<p>I had good fun playing the game, which reminded me that I&#8217;ve been meaning to get
better at assembly. I&#8217;ve made some (very) simple programs in x86 assembly
before, but I could really use some more practice and study. I <a href="http://gameboy.mongenel.com/asmschool.html">looked into</a>
learning a little Z80 assembly for the Game Boy, which dovetails nicely with my
interest in video games, and even built a little test <span class="caps">ROM</span>, but ultimately it
seemed more useful to study something I&#8217;m a bit more likely to use. So, I&#8217;ve
been reading <a href="http://download-mirror.savannah.gnu.org/releases/pgubook/ProgrammingGroundUp-1-0-booksize.pdf">Programming from the Ground Up</a>, which teaches Linux x86
assembly. It&#8217;s a little old, and could seriously use some proofreading, but it&#8217;s
a decent&nbsp;resource.</p>
<p>One error to note here: in Chapter 4, on page 63, there is a lovely diagram
indicating the current state of the stack at a certain point during the
execution of the code. Lovely, but wrong. It has the order of the &#8220;Base Number&#8221;
and &#8220;Power&#8221; reversed. When I first saw it, the reversed order made me think that
the top of the stack was at the top of the diagram, when in fact it is not. I
worked it out, of course, but it did cause me to do some double- and
triple-checking of the code to be sure. Caveat&nbsp;lector.</p>
<p>As for what purpose I&#8217;ll eventually put this to&#8230; I&#8217;ve got some ambitions to
write an emulator, and I hope to transfer this knowledge to other platforms. In
particular, I&#8217;m interested in looking at C64 assembly. It&#8217;d be nice to look at
some of those old games with a better idea of what&#8217;s going on! For now, though
it&#8217;s just learning for the sake of learning. I&#8217;m a way off from doing anything
very interesting with&nbsp;it.</p>                </article>
