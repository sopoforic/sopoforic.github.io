	<h6>Written by <a href="../author/tracy-poff.html">Tracy Poff</a> in <a href="../category/misc.html">misc</a> on Tue 06 October 2015. Tags: <a href="../tag/python.html">python</a>, <a href="../tag/quoted-forsooth.html">quoted forsooth</a>, </h6>
	<p>All of my public projects have been suffering, lately (not that I&#8217;ve ever been the most constant of writers), because I&#8217;ve been working in the background on a tool to aid me in my&nbsp;research.</p>
<p>Some background: Until now, I&#8217;ve been collecting my copious notes in <a href="http://wikidpad.sourceforge.net/">wikidPad</a>, a very nice personal wiki application. If all you need is a text-based notebook with some simple formatting and organizational capabilities, it&#8217;s great. I recommend it to everyone. My needs are a bit more extreme, though. I&#8217;ve currently got notes on about eighteen hundred individual items, along with pages of organizational and planning information. Making use of all the data I have stored in wikidPad was getting to be impossible, and, worse still, some of my notes were scattered in different locations elsewhere due to my needing features not supported by&nbsp;wikidPad.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tested the various available research notebook tools (Docear, Zotero, Mendeley, ReadCube, Evernote, OneNote, &#8230;) but most are heavily oriented toward research artifacts being PDFs (does no one use photographs, or recorded interviews, or anything? just PDFs?), and none had remotely powerful enough metadata and reporting&nbsp;capabilities.</p>
<p>So, I finally bit the bullet and created my own tool. It&#8217;s ugly and user-unfriendly right now, but for my purposes it&#8217;s already more useful than wikidPad, and I continue adding features as needs arise. The benefit of using custom-built software is that I can readily make any required modifications. If I want to see all of my screenshots of character selection screens for games released between 1987 and 1996, ordered by the name of the developer, with games I&#8217;ve never reviewed highlighted in green, I can have that in a couple of minutes. Television episodes about gambling written by people born before 1960? People who starred in movies from the nineties based on games released in the eighties? Games I haven&#8217;t beaten developed by defunct companies? Any desired query can be constructed in a few minutes, as long as the information is there. And a lack of information was never my&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if anyone else would find this useful. The lack of tools that did even remotely what I want seems to indicate that my needs are a bit idiosyncratic. I&#8217;ll probably release the code once I&#8217;ve got it in a less embarrassing state, all the&nbsp;same.</p>

	<p>I mentioned previously that I was working on a fanfiction database. Well, time
for an update: it’s in a functional state, though quite basic. I can feed it a
FanFiction.Net <span class="caps">ID</span> and it will download the fanfic and put it in the database
with some very basic metadata (author, <span class="caps">ID</span>, summary). Most recently, I’ve hacked
together an <span class="caps">HTTP</span> server using <code>http.server</code> so that I can accept commands over
<span class="caps">HTTP</span>. Currently, the only command it accepts is ‘add the fanfic at this <span class="caps">URL</span>’,
and it just responds with a status page and a copy of the form to add the fic to
favoritestracker. I really should use something a little more powerful than just
<code>http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler</code> for this&#8212;I really ought to create a
full-fledged web interface, instead of just a commands-over-http hack. But, for
the moment, that’s what I’ve&nbsp;got.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve neglected this blog, which I really shouldn&#8217;t have done.&nbsp;Well:</p>
<p>I must reiterate what I said in my last post: when adding tags, I should
definitely specify the revision I want to tag, because I keep making stupid
mistakes, tagging the wrong&nbsp;revisions.</p>
<p>That said, new project:
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/sopoforic/750-to-org/overview">750-to-org</a>. It&#8217;s just a
little python script to convert my 750 Words exports into a suitable format for
emacs org-mode. Nothing special, but I wanted it, so I figured I&#8217;d put it out
there in case anyone else might have a use for it. I did learn a little more
about datetime by doing it, too. I doubt I&#8217;ll ever remember the meanings of the
tokens for strftime, but at least I know it exists, now. It&#8217;s much cleaner that
the way I was going to produce the date&nbsp;strings.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a python/sqlalchemy fanfiction database thing I&#8217;m making for my
personal use, but it&#8217;s far from being in a fit state for public consumption.
More on that later,&nbsp;perhaps.</p>

	<h3><a href="../wordspy-again.html">WordsPy,&nbsp;again</a></h3>
	<h6>Written by <a href="../author/tracy-poff.html">Tracy Poff</a> in <a href="../category/misc.html">misc</a> on Sun 16 May 2010. Tags: <a href="../tag/wordspy.html">wordspy</a>, <a href="../tag/python.html">python</a>, </h6>
	<p>Well, the bad news is that wordspy still does nothing other than scroll new
lines onto the screen. The good news is that it does it in a better&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>In order to deal with letters dropping (due to letters below them being removed)
at the same time as a new line was scrolling up, it was necessary to re-engineer
the whole thing. Now letters store their current location, and it’s modified
whenever necessary by the newlinescroll and drop actions. This does have some
other benefits, too. For example, it simplifies drawing the new line onto the
screen somewhat. Before, I was&nbsp;doing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">col</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">screen</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">blit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Game</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">letters</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="n">col</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">image</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">64</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">col</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">481</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now, since I initialize the letters with their location, I can just&nbsp;do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">letter</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">Game</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">letters</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">]:</span>
    <span class="n">screen</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">blit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">letter</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">image</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">letter</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rect</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Which is rather more&nbsp;readable.</p>
<p>Lesson learned, though: don’t forget to empty the dirty rectangles list after
updating the screen. Once it grows to 64 items or so, it noticeably slows down
the game. I’m fairly sure it shouldn’t contain more than a dozen or so items
under normal usage, but I’ll have to remember to keep an eye on&nbsp;it.</p>

	<h6>Written by <a href="../author/tracy-poff.html">Tracy Poff</a> in <a href="../category/misc.html">misc</a> on Thu 11 February 2010. Tags: <a href="../tag/python.html">python</a>, <a href="../tag/game.html">game</a>, <a href="../tag/porting.html">porting</a>, <a href="../tag/basic.html">BASIC</a>, </h6>
	<p>Recently, I&#8217;ve been looking through a book called <em>Basic Computer Games: Microcomputer Edition</em>, edited by David H. Ahl. The book contains lots of type-in computer games written in Microsoft <span class="caps">BASIC</span> for the Altair. A fair number of these &#8216;games&#8217; are more like toys, and some aren&#8217;t even interactive, but a few look like real fun, and they&#8217;re all little pieces of computing history, which I find very&nbsp;interesting.</p>
<p>I thought I&#8217;d port a few of the more interesting games to a more modern language so people could check them out and see how far we&#8217;ve come (or, in some cases, how far we haven&#8217;t come). Of course, I thought I&#8217;d start by doing exactly what I didn&#8217;t set out to do, and port a very simple and not very interesting game, just to get a feel for it. Even this gave me a little pause, as I&#8217;ll get into. First, the game: <a href="http://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames/showpage.php?page=99" target="_blank">Letter</a>, by Bob Albrecht. That link leads to a scan of (a different edition of) the book I got the game from, so you can see the original <span class="caps">BASIC</span> code I was porting. Programmers among us will recognize that it&#8217;s extraordinarily simple, and, for a <span class="caps">BASIC</span> program, quite clean and readable. One thing gave me a little&nbsp;trouble:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">510</span> <span class="nt">FOR</span> <span class="nt">N</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nt">1</span> <span class="nt">TO</span> <span class="nt">15</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">PRINT</span> <span class="nt">CHR</span><span class="o">$(</span><span class="nt">7</span><span class="o">);:</span> <span class="nt">NEXT</span> <span class="nt">N</span><span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">pre</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This line didn&#8217;t seem to affect the output in the printed sample run of the game, so I got an Altair emulator, just to be sure. Indeed, it doesn&#8217;t actually print, though I have no idea why. Whatever the reason, I left it out so as to faithfully reproduce the game as it was on the original system, whatever the code&nbsp;says.</p>
<p>A part of my intention in porting these is to provide sample code for people who may be interested in learning to program; these simple games should prove to be pretty easy to understand for anyone who cares to look. Having just read through quite a lot of <span class="caps">BASIC</span> code, I wasn&#8217;t in a very pythonic frame of mind when writing this, but I think it&#8217;ll be clear&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>Enough about my troubles, though. You can find the game <a href="http://bitbucket.org/sopoforic/letter/">here</a>. If you have python installed, you can just get <a href="http://bitbucket.org/sopoforic/letter/raw/4a46e69f19b3/letter.py">the tiny python source file</a>. If not, or if you&#8217;re not sure, you can get <a href="http://bitbucket.org/sopoforic/letter/downloads/LETTER.zip">a <span class="caps">ZIP</span> with a Windows executable</a>, instead, which should run on anything from Windows 95 through Vista. If it won&#8217;t run, or complains of missing files, you may need <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9b2da534-3e03-4391-8a4d-074b9f2bc1bf&amp;displaylang=en">this</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll port something more interesting, and hopefully more fun, next time. Until then, I <span class="caps">HAVE</span> A <span class="caps">LETTER</span>. <span class="caps">START</span> <span class="caps">GUESSING</span>.</p>

	<h3><a href="../a-fast-algorithm-for-computing-fibonacci-numbers.html">A Fast Algorithm for Computing Fibonacci&nbsp;Numbers</a></h3>
	<h6>Written by <a href="../author/tracy-poff.html">Tracy Poff</a> in <a href="../category/misc.html">misc</a> on Sat 10 October 2009. Tags: <a href="../tag/python.html">python</a>, </h6>
	<p>I came across an algorithm for computing Fibonacci numbers in <a href="http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110002725383/en">a paper by
Takahashi Daisuke</a>; the paper&#8217;s in
Japanese, but the pseudocode of the algorithm is plain enough that it&#8217;s easy to
understand, even if I can&#8217;t read any of the explanation. I&#8217;ve implemented it in
python, and it&#8217;s decidedly slower than the Fibonacci function in Mathematica,
though that&#8217;s to be expected. My implementation takes quite a few seconds to
compute F(2^20) but is quick for numbers below about F(2^15), with the
additional benefits of not computing absurdly huge floats or recursing a million&nbsp;times.</p>
<p>The algorithm is apparently a refinement of another (perhaps well-known?)
algorithm, which computes Fibonacci numbers from the product of Lucas numbers.
I&#8217;ll have to look into it to see just how it&nbsp;works.</p>
<p>Edit: After some investigation, a large part of Mathematica&#8217;s apparent advantage
is in its faster display, rather than faster computation, though Mathematica
does still beat my python program by a rather huge amount&#8212;Mathematica computes
Fibonacci[2^23] in about 0.2 seconds, while my program takes just over five
seconds. This disparity increases as the argument grows larger. Also, found an
English version of that paper.&nbsp;Neat.</p>
