A tiny break from actually mapping out memory to post my current memory map. Mostly empty, but Rome wasn't built in a day, right?

There's probably lots of padding in there, and it's probable that the section with the board posts in it is used for nothing else. If everything works the way it looks like it does, so far, then I've got a general idea of what about a quarter of the save file is for. Not too bad. The next few saves will probably give me a picture of how character stats and inventory are stored, so that should be another big chunk of it. Progress!
