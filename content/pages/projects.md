Since my projects are scattered about, here I'll collect a few of them.

## CGRR

Broadly speaking, the purpose of this is to decode various file formats, in
particular those associated with old games. It's split into a number of smaller
subprojects that use a common library, each typically supporting a single game.

[cgrr](https://github.com/sopoforic/cgrr)
:    The common library on which the other projects are based.

[cgrr-archery](https://github.com/sopoforic/cgrr-archery)
:    Read and write score files for Archery, a DOS game by Brian Blankenship.

[cgrr-dangerousdave](https://github.com/sopoforic/cgrr-dangerousdave)
:    Extract the EGA tiles from the DOS game Dangerous Dave by John Romero.

[cgrr-gameboy](https://github.com/sopoforic/cgrr-gameboy)
:    Read and edit Game Boy ROM headers.

[cgrr-kobodeluxe](https://github.com/sopoforic/cgrr-kobodeluxe)
:    Read and write score and profile files for Kobo Deluxe, a game by David
     Olofson.

[cgrr-mariospicross](https://github.com/sopoforic/cgrr-mariospicross)
:    Read and edit puzzles for the Game Boy game Mario's Picross.

[cgrr-megapede](https://github.com/sopoforic/cgrr-megapede)
:    Read score files and resources for Megapede, a game by Cheesy Software.

## Other projects

[750-to-org](https://bitbucket.org/sopoforic/750-to-org)
:    A script that takes monthly export files from 750 words and converts them
     for use with emacs org-mode.

[autofill-ebay](https://bitbucket.org/sopoforic/autofill-ebay)
:    A greasemonkey script that automatically populates the 'maximum bid' box on
     eBay with the minimum possible bid, to ease bidding and prevent errors.

[Mobygames Scripts](https://bitbucket.org/sopoforic/mobygames-scripts)
:    A collection of greasemonkey scripts for use on
     [MobyGames](http://www.mobygames.com/).

## Abandoned projects and miscellany

[letter](https://bitbucket.org/sopoforic/letter)
:    A python conversion of a simple letter-guessing game by Bob Albrecht and
     David H. Ahl. Part of an experiment to capture the way old type-in BASIC
     games encouraged users to edit them, by their mere accessibility.

[WordsPy](https://bitbucket.org/sopoforic/wordspy)
:   An incomplete word construction game built on pygame.
