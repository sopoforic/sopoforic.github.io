I've neglected this blog, which I really shouldn't have done. Well:

I must reiterate what I said in my last post: when adding tags, I should
definitely specify the revision I want to tag, because I keep making stupid
mistakes, tagging the wrong revisions.

That said, new project:
[750-to-org](https://bitbucket.org/sopoforic/750-to-org/overview). It's just a
little python script to convert my 750 Words exports into a suitable format for
emacs org-mode. Nothing special, but I wanted it, so I figured I'd put it out
there in case anyone else might have a use for it. I did learn a little more
about datetime by doing it, too. I doubt I'll ever remember the meanings of the
tokens for strftime, but at least I know it exists, now. It's much cleaner that
the way I was going to produce the date strings.

I've got a python/sqlalchemy fanfiction database thing I'm making for my
personal use, but it's far from being in a fit state for public consumption.
More on that later, perhaps.
