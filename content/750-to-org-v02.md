I did a little cleanup on the code for 750-to-org, so I went ahead and called it
0.2. I did some more testing, so unless 750 Words does something quite
unexpected, 750-to-org should just work.

I should probably set 750-to-org up so you can give it filenames as arguments,
but other than that, I can’t think of much else I’d want it to do. I could have
it verify that it’s putting entries in the right places, in case the exports are
processed out of order, but that just seems like more work than is necessary.
Unless someone complains about it, I’m just going to leave it.
