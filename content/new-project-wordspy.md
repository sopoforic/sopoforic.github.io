I found that I wanted to play Word Zap/Word Jolt/Bookworm/whatever word
construction game, but I didn’t seem to have one on hand, and [the version of
Bookworm I found](http://www.popcap.com/games/free/bookworm) was far from
satisfying. So, I did what anyone would do: set out to make my own.

I’ve been wanting to learn to use pygame for a while, and this seemed like a
good opportunity. I’ve had my fair share of trouble so far, but I think I’m
beginning to get a handle on how to use it. It’s
[here](http://bitbucket.org/sopoforic/wordspy) for now, though it’s not playable
yet--it only generates the letters and scrolls them onto the screen. Still, it’s
a start.
