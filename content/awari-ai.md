I've sorted out the BASIC version of Awari I'm porting into the 'draw the board'
routine, the 'make a move' routine and the 'incomprehensible AI' routine. The AI
seems to first sow from the first nonempty pit, then makes some weird comparison
and modifies a value:

```
860 FOR I=0 TO N-1:IF F(N)*6+K=INT(F(I)/6^(7-C)+.1) THEN Q=Q-2
```

The reason for that is fairly inscrutable. F is some array, and the program
claims to have a learning mechanism to improve the AI, so I suspect this is that
mechanism, but I'm not at all sure how it's meant to work. I think I'll have to
make a flow chart or something to decipher this thing. This would be easier if
the variables had meaningful names. I remember once, when I was first learning
to program, I thought that using meaningful names was a big waste of time, since
after all the code should be pretty self-evident, right? A second look at my
code after some weeks disabused me of that notion, and this serves to reinforce
that: code should be self-evident, but it won't be if you don't work at it.

Oh well. With any luck, I'll be able to sort this out with an hour or so of
concerted effortâ€“it's just that reading BASIC is giving me a headache and I
haven't yet put in the requisite time. I must persevere!
