As of the most recent revision (r18:6453f11b96e6), WordsPy functions as a (bad)
game. The dictionary is hooked up, and it only lets you remove letters if they
form a word in the dictionary (Thatâ€™s a rule. Games have rules. Ergo, game.
Right?).

Other features:

* Selected letters are highlighted
* Backspace support
* Nonstop key-pressing action!

Next steps will be arranging it so the letter generator provides useful letters
rather than just random ones (probably just analyze the dictionary for letter
frequencies and use that), creating some kind of status display, and additional
nice things (score? list of words you made in that session? difficulty levels?
the possibilities are endless!)

Edit: and a screenshot for posterity.
