After many months of procrastination, I've finally split up my cgrr project and
transferred it to github. It took quite a while, but in the end I think it will
be much more maintainable and useful with each of the parser modules taken
separately than it would be with them all jammed together pretending to be
plugins for some yet-unwritten master program. If I want to write some wrapper
around them all later, they'll perfectly well support it, but until then, all
the plugin stuff is just an extra mess--YAGNI.
