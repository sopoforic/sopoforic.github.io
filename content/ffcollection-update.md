Somehow, I didn't have the source code for ffcollection under version control.
No idea how I managed that, since it's usually the first thing I do. Stranger
still that I didn't notice I wasn't occasionally committing--I don't use any
kind of automatic committing tool, so I'm usually typing 'hg commit' after
pretty much any little change. Version numbers are free, after all. Anyway, I
remedied that, and made some more progress. I need to make some minor changes to
the database schema, and the whole thing needs some serious refactoring, but
it's coming along pretty nicely. Certainly it's useful for me. Now, if only I
could make an interface that wasn't horrible, I'd be pretty happy with things.
Well, some day.
