BeautifulSoup is really excellent. I should have started using it ages ago. In
probably less than an hour, I turned my custom-built horrible, fragile,
regex monstrosity of a parser into a much more robust and, more importantly,
understandable scraper with half as many lines of code.

The lesson, as it often is, is to use the right tool for the job.
