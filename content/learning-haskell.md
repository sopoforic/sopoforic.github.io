I've been learning Haskell (following [Learn You a Haskell for Great
Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)) and, although it's been fairly
mind-bending at times, I think I'm progressing well enough. I still need to
learn the idiomatic ways to do things--I guess I'm still 'writing Python in
Haskell'â€“but I'm generally not too lost on what to do. Although since I'm
currently using Haskell to solve Project Euler problems, I may be solving only
problems which are conducive to a functional approach.
